### Purpose

This document has been developed as part of the CDC-TAP project as part of the year 4 scope of work. It is intended to document four priority Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (MER) Indicators whose selection is based on the rationale outlined in the Indicator selection rationale document. The indicators in scope include TX_Curr, TX_New, TX_RTT, and TX_PVLS. This project is aimed at standardizing the indicator generation approach using the SMART guidelines approach. It will compare the process and results of computing the indicators through the SMART guidelines approach and through the approach used in KenyaEMR currently. Through this, differences in the WHO HIV SMART guidelines and in the Kenyan adaptation will be highlighted.

This project is led by IntelliSOFT Consulting Limited and Palladium Kenya working closely with PATH and other CDC TAP consortium partners.
