### Introduction to Digital Adaptation Kits (DAKs)

Digital Adaptation Kits (DAKs) are part of the SMART guidelines initiative and include data and health content consistent with clinical recommendations, generically applicable to digital systems. DAKs are software-neutral, operational, and structured documentation based on clinical, health system and data use recommendations to systematically and transparently inform the design of digital systems.

Components of this DAK will include:

1. Linked health interventions and recommendations
2. Personas
3. User scenarios
4. Business processes and workflows
5. Core data elements mapped to standard terminology codes
6. Decision support
7. Program indicators
8. Functional and non-functional requirements.

### Purpose

This document has been developed as part of the CDC-TAP project as part of the year 4 scope of work. It is intended to document four priority Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (MER) Indicators whose selection is based on the rationale outlined in the Indicator selection rationale document. The indicators in scope include TX_Curr, TX_New, TX_RTT, and TX_PVLS. This project is aimed at standardizing the indicator generation approach using the SMART guidelines approach. It will compare the process and results of computing the indicators through the SMART guidelines approach and through the approach used in KenyaEMR currently. Through this, differences in the WHO HIV SMART guidelines and in the Kenyan adaptation will be highlighted.

This project is led by IntelliSOFT Consulting Limited and Palladium Kenya working closely with PATH and other CDC TAP consortium partners.

### Document Conventions

This document follows the SMART guidelines Digital Adaptation Kit format and covers all eight DAK components.
