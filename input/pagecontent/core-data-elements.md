This section outlines the core set of data elements corresponding to different points of the workflow within the identified business processes. These data elements provide the foundation for executing the decision-support logic, as well as populating indicators and performance metrics.

### Simplified List of Core Data Elements

We noted that if we use our own data element IDs for both the data dictionary and the decision logic tables we would need to at some point change them later if the HIV Kenya EMR DAK is to be expanded later in future. We therefore simply adapted the WHO DAK IDs and mapped them to our own Kenya EMR DAK core data elements so as to provide flexibility for expansion in future.
