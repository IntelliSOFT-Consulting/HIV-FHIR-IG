### Notation Guidance

Within this HIV DAK identification (ID) numbers simplify tracking and referencing of each of the components. Note that this DAK represents an overview across the different components, while the comprehensive and complete outputs of each component (that is, data dictionary, and decision-support tables) are included in appended spreadsheets.

The notation guidance is as follows:

-   **Component 1: Health interventions and associated recommendations**
    -   No notations used
-   **Component 2: Generic personas**
    -   No notations used
-   **Component 3: User scenarios**
    -   No notations used
-   **Component 4: Business processes and workflows**
    -   Each workflow has a “Process name” and a corresponding “Process ID”, for example, “HIV.A”.
    -   Each activity in the workflow has an “Activity ID” following the process name and process ID letter – thus, for example, “HIV.A7”.
-   **Component 5: Core data elements (data dictionary)**
    -   Each data element has a running number and a “Data Element (DE) ID” that is structured as follows: “Abbreviated health domain” (that is, HIV) and a Sequential number of the data element – thus, for example, “HIV.A7.DE.1”, “HIV.A7.DE.2”.
-   **Component 6: Decision-support logic**
    -   Each decision-support logic table has a running number and a “Decision-support table (DT) ID” that is structured as follows: “Abbreviated health domain” (that is, HIV).”DT and Sequential number of the decision-support table” – thus, for example, “HIV.DT.01”.
-   **Component 7: Indicators and performance metrics**
    -   Each indicator has an “Indicator ID” that is structured as follows: “Abbreviated health domain” (that is, HIV).”IND.“ and Sequential or reference number of the indicator” – thus, for example, “HIV.IND.PR.1”.
-   **Component 8: High-level system requirements**
    -   Each functional requirement has a “Functional requirement ID” structured as follows: “Abbreviated health domain” (that is, HIV).”FXN.REQ” and a “Sequential number of the functional requirement” – thus, for example, “HIV.FXN.REQ.1”.
    -   Each non-functional requirement has a “Non-functional requirement ID” that is structured as follows: “Abbreviated health domain” (that is, HIV). ”NFXNREQ and a Sequential number of non-functional requirement” – thus, for example, “HIV.NFXNREQ.001”.
