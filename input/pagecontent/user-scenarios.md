User scenarios are stories that explain how different personas might interact with each other and provide an illustrative idea of a typical workflow. This section aims to clarify how different personas identified in section 2 would fit into the existing workflows.

            Ann, a 29-year-old lady, has been feeling unwell for the past week. Ann realized she had missed her menstrual period for one month and was curious to know whether she might be pregnant. Ann does a self-pregnancy test and finds out she is pregnant. Ann decides to visit TumuTumu hospital for further assessment and also to start the antenatal clinic journey.<br>
At the hospital, Ann finds Julie(clinician), who takes her history and recommends a repeat pregnancy test for confirmation. Ann goes to the lab and finds Miano(Lab technologist) who does a pregnancy test which turns out to be positive. Ann proceeds back to the consultation room and finds  Julie. Julie accesses Annâ€™s results from the EMR system. Julie congratulates Ann and opens an antenatal form for her.<br>
As part of the routine tests, Ann is informed that part of the tests that need to be done include HIV test. Ann gives consent for HIV test. Julie directs Ann to the HTS provider who counsels her and proceeds to do the test. The test turns out to be positive. Post-counselling is done and she is advised on linkage to care and treatment. Ann agrees to receive care and treatment from the same facility. Ann is directed back to Julie who stresses to her the need to start treatment immediately and attend all antenatal visits to prevent mother-to-child transmission. Ann agrees with her and admits she is ready to start the treatment immediately.
Julie links Ann to Francis (HRIO) for ART enrollment. Francis registers Ann in the ART system and gives her a unique identifier number. He enrolls her in the ART clinic where she will be receiving treatment services.<br>
When generating TX-NEW for January 2024, Ann was part of the report as she was enrolled irregardless of her pregnancy status.
