 * Ref No: PRV.14
 * Short Name: OAMT minimum dose
 *
 * Definition: % of OAMT recipients receiving a maintenance dose greater than or equal to the recommended minimum dose
 *
 * Numerator: Number of people, at a specified date, maintained on methadone or buprenorphine receiving recommended minimum maintenance dose (WHO guidance recommends doses of ≥60 mg of methadone or ≥8 mg of buprenorphine*)
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with ("Medications prescribed"='Methadone' AND "Dose of medications prescribed" GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 60mg) OR ("Medications prescribed"='Buprenorphine' AND "Dose of medications prescribed" GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 8mg) for a specified "Reporting date"
 * Numerator Exclusions: "Client being inducted on OAMT" OR "Client on reducing doses of OAMT"
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people receiving maintenance dose of methadone or buprenorphine at a specified date, excluding: a) individuals currently being inducted on OAMT and yet to reach the maintenance dose and b) individuals on reducing doses of OAMT.
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "Medications prescribed" IN 'Methadone', 'Buprenorphine' for a specified "Reporting date"
 * Denominator Exclusions: "Client being inducted on OAMT" OR "Client on reducing doses of OAMT"
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other**) 
 *  • Age (15–19, 20–24, 25–49, 50+ years) 
 *  • Provider type (key population-led or community-led organization, public sector provider, other entities such as private for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including faith-based, international, nongovernmental) 
 *  • Setting: facility-based service (including hospitals, health clinics, general practice offices, etc.) or community-based service (including drop-in centres, community service delivery points, mobile clinics or vans, outreach teams, community support groups, etc.) 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * Dose of medications prescribed 
 *  Medications prescribed 
 *  Reporting date

 * 
 * Data Concepts:
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth
 * HIV.A.DE18: Gender* | Gender of the client*
 * HIV.A.DE19: Female | Client identifies as female
 * HIV.A.DE20: Male | Client identifies as male
 * HIV.A.DE21: Transgender male | Client identifies as transgender male
 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category
 * HIV.C.DE75: Medications prescribed | Medications the client was prescribed
 * HIV.C.DE76: PrEP for HIV prevention | Client was prescribed pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention
 * HIV.C.DE77: PEP for HIV prevention | Client was prescribed post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV prevention
 * HIV.C.DE78: Other | Client was prescribed other medications
 * HIV.D.DE457: Medications prescribed | Name or regimen code of all other medications prescribed during the visit
 * HIV.D.DE459: Dose of medications prescribed | Number of doses (quantity taken at a single point in time) of drugs prescribed/dispensed
 * HIV.Config.DE22: Reporting date | Reporting date, for surveys performed on a specific date
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: Measures the proportion of OAMT recipients receiving the recommended minimum maintenance dose.
 * - rationale: Evidence demonstrates that maximum benefit from OAMT is gained when individuals receive at least the recommended minimum maintenance dose.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
