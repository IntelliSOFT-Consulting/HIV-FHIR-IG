 * Short Name: Total PrEP recipients
 *
 * Definition: Number of people who received PrEP at least once during the reporting period
 *
 * Numerator: Number of people prescribed or dispensed any form of PrEP at least once during the reporting period. Individuals prescribed different PrEP products or regimens at different times during the reporting period should be counted only once.
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "Medications prescribed"='PrEP for HIV prevention' with "Date medications prescribed" in the reporting period
 * Numerator Exclusions:

 * Denominator: 1
 * Denominator Calculation: 1
 * Denominator Exclusions:

 * Disaggregations:
 * • Age (15–19, 20–24, 25–49, 50+ years) 
 *  • Gender (female, male, other*) 
 *  • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)** 
 *  • PrEP product and formulation (oral, long-acting device, long-acting injectable). Some people may start, continue, stop and restart, one or multiple times with different products or formulations in a given reporting period. Because of this, the percentages of recipients receiving different PrEP products may total more than 100%. 
 *  • Experience with PrEP (first time, continuing, or restarting following a period of not 
 *  taking PrEP) 
 *  • Provider type (key population-led or community-led organization, public sector provider, other entities such as private for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including faith- based, international, nongovernmental) 
 *  • Setting: facility-based service (including hospitals, health clinics, general practice offices, etc.) or community-based service (including drop-in centres, community service delivery points, mobile clinics or vans, outreach teams, community support groups, etc.) 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance

 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This indicator measures the number of people receiving any PrEP product during the reporting period, including people starting PrEP for the first time, restarting PrEP, continuing PrEP or switching from one PrEP product to another.
 * - rationale: • The use of ARV medicines by people who are HIV-negative before they are exposed to HIV can prevent HIV infection. | • Through disaggregation, this indicator can help managers compare the uptake and use of PrEP among different types of users (for example, by first-time users, and members of priority populations).
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records. |  | If individual-level data are not available, the indicator can be reported using aggregate programme data. Because de-duplication is not possible, individuals prescribed multiple | PrEP products or formulations at different times during the reporting period maybe counted multiple times, and the number reported may be greater than the number of unique individuals receiving PrEP during the reporting period.
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: continuous-variable | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/cv-measure-cqfm
