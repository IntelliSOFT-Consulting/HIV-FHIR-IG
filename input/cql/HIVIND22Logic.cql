 * Definition: Number of people who were identified and tested using partner testing services and who received their results
 *
 * Numerator: For the general population: Number of elicited partners and other contacts* of people diagnosed with HIV who received HTS |  | Additional cascade data collected: | • Number of people diagnosed with HIV (index cases) offered partner services | • Number of people diagnosed with HIV (index cases) accepting partner services | • Number of contacts/partners of people living with HIV whose information is elicited from people diagnosed with HIV (index cases) |  | For key populations: Number of elicited contacts1 of members of key populations who received HTS. | Additional cascade data collected: | • Number of key population members offered social network-based/partner services | • Number of key population members accepting social network-based/partner services | • Number of contacts of key population members elicited
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients "Referred through partner services" that are a 'Partner or contact of an index case' AND "Type of contact or partner for partner services" IN 'Sexual partner', 'Drug-injecting partner' with "HIV test date" AND "Date HIV test results returned" in the reporting period

 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse

 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting
 * HIV.E.DE224: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test
 * HIV.PRV.DE11: HIV status of contact | The HIV status of the client's contact
 * HIV.PRV.DE12: HIV-positive | Client's contact is HIV-positive
 * HIV.PRV.DE13: HIV-negative | Client's contact is HIV-negative
 * HIV.PRV.DE14: Unknown | Client does not know contact's HIV status
 * HIV.SRV.DE1: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This measures the coverage and impact of the testing cascade of services for partners and other contacts* of people living with HIV, including key population members.
 * - rationale: • Contact testing, including among sexual partners, has been shown to increase the diagnosis of already-infected contacts and partners of newly identified HIV cases. | • Among serodiscordant couples, partner notification and testing can be a critical step in preventing infection of the uninfected partner. | • Contact and/or partner notification and testing should be voluntary and provided with supportive services.
 * - method: Patient monitoring data (HIV index testing services register or logbook, HTS registers or reporting forms) or EMR
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: continuous-variable | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/cv-measure-cqfm
