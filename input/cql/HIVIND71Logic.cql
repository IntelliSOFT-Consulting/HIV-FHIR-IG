 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: A: % of people attending HIV prevention services who were tested for gonorrhoea | (molecular test, culture or POC test) during the reporting period | B: % of people living with HIV who were tested for gonorrhoea (using a molecular test, culture or POC test) during the reporting period
 * - rationale: • Infection with an acute bacterial sexually transmitted infection such as gonorrhoea is a marker of unprotected sexual intercourse and facilitates HIV transmission and acquisition. | • Measuring the burden of gonorrhoea among people living with HIV and among populations at risk of HIV can help national planners determine the resources needed to address both diseases. | • Testing for gonorrhoea identifies individuals who would benefit from treatment. | • Testing coverage measures progress towards scaling up screening/testing and can be used to assess whether national screening guidelines are being followed.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records.   |  | If individual-level data are not available, the indicator can be reported using aggregate programme data. If aggregate data are used and it is not possible to exclude individuals who are tested more than once during the reporting period, the testing coverage estimates will be inflated.

 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
