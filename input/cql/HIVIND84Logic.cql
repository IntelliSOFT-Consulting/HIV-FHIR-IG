 * Library: HIV.IND.84 Logic
 * Ref No: HEP.2B
 * Short Name: HCV test coverage, HIV-positive clients
 *
 * Definition: % of people living with HIV who were tested for HCV (HCV antibody, HCV RNA or HCV core antigen) during the reporting period (laboratory-based test or rapid test)
 *
 * Numerator: Number of people living with HIV tested for HCV (HCV antibody, HCV RNA or HCV core antigen) during the reporting period
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "HIV status"='HIV-positive' with "HCV test date" in the reporting period
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people living with HIV attending HIV care and treatment services during the reporting period
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "HIV status"='HIV-positive' AND with a "Visit date" in the reporting period
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other*) 
 *  • Age (15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–49, 50+ years) 
 *  • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)** 
 *  • Provider type (key population-led or community-led organization, public-sector provider, other entities such as private for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including faith- based, international, nongovernmental) 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age | Key population member type
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * HCV test date 
 *  HIV status 
 *  Visit date
 *
 * Reference: Consolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV strategic information: strengthening routine data for impact. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2022
 * 
 * Data Concepts:
 * HIV.A.DE3: Visit date | The date and time of the client's visit
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth
 * HIV.A.DE18: Gender* | Gender of the client*
 * HIV.A.DE19: Female | Client identifies as female
 * HIV.A.DE20: Male | Client identifies as male
 * HIV.A.DE21: Transgender male | Client identifies as transgender male
 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category
 * HIV.B.DE50: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the client is included in
 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.B.DE55: People living in prisons and other closed settings | Client lives in a prison or another closed setting
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status
 * HIV.D.DE169: HCV test date | Date client was tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV antibody, HCV RNA or HCV core antigen)
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting
 * HIV.G.DE42: HCV test date | Date client was tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV antibody, HCV RNA or HCV core antigen)
 * HIV.SRV.DE15: Visit date | The date and time of the client's visit
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: A: % of people attending HIV prevention services who were tested for HCV during the reporting period (laboratory-based test or rapid test) | B: % of people living with HIV who were tested for HCV during the reporting period (laboratory-based test or rapid test)
 * - rationale: • Measuring the hepatitis burden among people living with HIV and in populations at risk can help national planners determine the resources needed to address both diseases. Testing for HCV co-infection among people living with HIV can inform clinicians on the need for further clinical and laboratory evaluation and the need to adapt treatment. | • Disaggregated estimates can point to gaps in diagnosing people infected with HCV.
 * - method: Patient monitoring tools (electronic or paper), for example, hepatitis and HIV testing service records, lab registers, logbooks and reporting forms at facility and community levels, EMR/electronic information systems
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
