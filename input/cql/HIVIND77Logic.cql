 * HIV.B.DE233: Other | Other syndrome/STI diagnosed
 * HIV.B.DE235: Any STI syndrome diagnosed | Was the client diagnosed with any of the five STI syndromes during this visit?
 * HIV.D.DE778: Syndrome/STI diagnosed | Syndrome or STI for which client is diagnosed
 * HIV.D.DE779: Urethral discharge syndrome | Client diagnosed with urethral discharge syndrome

 * HIV.D.DE783: Anorectal discharge | Client diagnosed with anorectal discharge
 * HIV.D.DE784: Sent for testing | Specimen sent for testing
 * HIV.D.DE785: Other | Other syndrome/STI diagnosed
 * HIV.D.DE787: Any STI syndrome diagnosed | Was the client diagnosed with any of the five STI syndromes during this visit?
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs

 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting
 * HIV.SRV.DE15: Visit date | The date and time of the client's visit
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: A: % of people attending HIV prevention services who were diagnosed with one of five STI syndromes during the reporting period | B: % of people living with HIV who were diagnosed with one of five STI syndromes during the reporting period
 * - rationale: • Diagnosis and treatment of syndromic STIs improves health, reduces transmission of STIs and contributes to a reduction in the transmission of HIV. | • In most resource-limited settings, the WHO syndromic treatment guidelines are still the standard of care when laboratory diagnosis is not available or where the results will take several days. | • The WHO 2021 guidelines for the management of symptomatic infections covers five syndromes: urethral discharge syndrome, vaginal discharge syndrome, lower abdominal pain, genital ulcer disease syndrome, and anorectal discharge. | • In countries that are looking to start collecting STI syndromic data, the STI syndromes to focus on initially are: urethral discharge syndrome, genital ulcer disease syndrome and vaginal discharge syndrome.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records.   |  | If individual-level data are not available, the indicator can be reported using aggregate programme data. If aggregate data are used and it is not possible to exclude individuals who are tested more than once during the reporting period, the testing coverage estimates will be inflated.
