 * Library: HIV.IND.33 Logic
 * Ref No: ART.7
 * Short Name: Early viral load testing (at six months)
 *
 * Definition: Number and % of people living with HIV on ART who had a viral load result reviewed by six months after initiation of ART
 *
 * Numerator: Number of people living with HIV on ART who were eligible for VL monitoring at six months after initiation of ART during the reporting period and who had a VL test performed and result reviewed by six months after ART initiation
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "HIV status"='HIV-positive' AND "On ART"=True AND "ART start date" is within reporting period AND "Date viral load test results received by client" within 6 months of "ART start date"
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people living with HIV on ART eligible for VL monitoring at six months after initiation of ART during the reporting period
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "HIV status"='HIV-positive' AND "On ART"=True AND "ART start date" is within reporting period
 * Denominator Exclusions:

 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other**) 
 *  • Age (0–4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–19, 20–24, 25–49, 50+ years)*** 
 *  • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)**** 
 *  • Other priority populations 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age | Key population member type | Other priority populations

 * Data Concepts:
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth
 * HIV.A.DE18: Gender* | Gender of the client*
 * HIV.A.DE19: Female | Client identifies as female
 * HIV.A.DE20: Male | Client identifies as male
 * HIV.A.DE21: Transgender male | Client identifies as transgender male
 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category
 * HIV.B.DE50: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the client is included in
 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.B.DE55: People living in prisons and other closed settings | Client lives in a prison or another closed setting
 * HIV.B.DE72: ART start date | The date on which the client started or restarted antiretroviral therapy (ART)
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status
 * HIV.D.DE38: On ART | Client is currently taking ART
 * HIV.D.DE39: ART start date | The date on which the client started or restarted ART
 * HIV.D.DE193: Date viral load test results received by client | The date on which the client received results from viral load test
 * HIV.D.DE417: Date viral load test results received by client | The date on which the client received results from a viral load test
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting
 * HIV.H.DE47: On ART | Client is currently taking ART 
 * HIV.SRV.DE6: ART start date | The date on which the client started or restarted antiretroviral therapy (ART)
 * HIV.Config.DE19: Other priority populations | Other populations of priority of HIV prevention and care in local context (provided during adaptation)
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: Measures the extent to which people newly initiating ART receive appropriate and rapid follow-up VL testing to check virologic suppression and to provide an early warning to prompt adherence support and avoid HIV drug resistance.*
 * - rationale: • WHO currently recommends VL testing for all people living with HIV at six months after ART initiation to assess VLS and, in the event of non-suppression, to identify persons in need of intensive adherence counselling and follow-up. | • Virologic suppression is essential to the 95–95–95-related impact goals. | • This indicator complements the VL testing coverage (ART.6) and VL suppression (ART.3) indicators.
 * - method: For the numerator and denominator: Patient monitoring tools (for example, ART registers, cohort reporting forms, patient records/EMRs, laboratory information system) |  | The time window for early VL monitoring can include a margin of +/– one month, that is, a routine VL test can take place any time from five to seven months after initiation of ART.
