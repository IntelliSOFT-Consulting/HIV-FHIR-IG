 * Library: HIV.IND.25 Logic
 * Ref No: HTS.8
 * Short Name: HIV retesting coverage
 *
 * Definition: % of people testing HIV-negative who tested again within a defined period of time after their previous test
 *
 * Numerator: Number of individuals who tested HIV-negative assessed to be at elevated risk for HIV acquisition who had another HIV test within a defined period after previous test.
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "At elevated risk for HIV acquisition"=True AND with a second "HIV test date" within fixed period after "HIV test date" in the reporting period with "HIV test result"='HIV-negative'
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people assessed as being at elevated risk for HIV acquisition (includes people requesting/receiving any HIV prevention intervention, people from key populations, people with known risk factors or those assessed as being at risk of HIV acquisition) who received an HIV-negative test result in the reporting period.
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "At elevated risk for HIV acquisition"=True AND with an "HIV test date" in the reporting period with "HIV test result"='HIV-negative'
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other*) 
 *  • Age (<15, 15–19, 20–24, 25–49, 50+ years)** 
 *  • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)*** 
 *  • Provider type (key population-led or community-led organization, public sector provider, other entities such as private for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including faith-based, international, nongovernmental) 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age | Key population member type

 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * At elevated risk for HIV acquisition

 * HIV.A.DE20: Male | Client identifies as male
 * HIV.A.DE21: Transgender male | Client identifies as transgender male
 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category
 * HIV.B.DE50: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the client is included in
 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.B.DE55: People living in prisons and other closed settings | Client lives in a prison or another closed setting
 * HIV.B.DE110: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test
 * HIV.B.DE111: HIV test result | The result from HIV testing after applying the testing algorithm
 * HIV.B.DE112: HIV-positive | Test result is HIV-positive
 * HIV.B.DE113: HIV-negative | Test result is HIV-negative
 * HIV.B.DE114: HIV-inconclusive | Test result is HIV-inconclusive
 * HIV.B.DE225: At elevated risk for HIV acquisition | Client is at elevated risk for HIV acquisition
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting
 * HIV.E.DE224: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test
 * HIV.PRV.DE1: At elevated risk for HIV acquisition | Client is at elevated risk for HIV acquisition, defined according to country/programme context
 * HIV.SRV.DE1: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test
 * HIV.SRV.DE2: HIV test result | The result from HIV testing after applying the testing algorithm
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This indicator measures the rate of retesting for HIV among those at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition.
 * - rationale: For those individuals who test negative for HIV but are at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition, retesting is encouraged. The recommended frequency of re-testing will differ for different groups in different settings. The level of retesting examined by this indicator should aligned with national recommendations.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
