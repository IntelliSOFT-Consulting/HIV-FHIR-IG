 * 
 * Data Concepts:
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status
 * HIV.B.DE249: Syphilis test date | Date of syphilis test
 * HIV.B.DE250: Syphilis test result | Result from syphilis test
 * HIV.B.DE251: Positive | Test result is positive for syphilis
 * HIV.B.DE252: Negative | Test result is negative for syphilis
 * HIV.B.DE253: Inconclusive | Test result is inconclusive
 * HIV.B.DE254: Syphilis treatment start date | Date of initiation of syphilis treatment
 * HIV.D.DE801: Syphilis test date | Date of syphilis test
 * HIV.D.DE802: Syphilis test result | Result from syphilis test
 * HIV.D.DE803: Positive | Test result is positive for syphilis
 * HIV.D.DE804: Negative | Test result is negative for syphilis
 * HIV.D.DE805: Inconclusive | Test result is inconclusive
 * HIV.D.DE806: Syphilis treatment start date | Date of initiation of syphilis treatment
 * HIV.E.DE85: ANC contact date | The date and time of the client's ANC contact (in the ANC DAK this is called 'Contact date')
 * HIV.G.DE69: Syphilis test date | Date of syphilis test
 * HIV.G.DE70: Syphilis test result | Result from syphilis test
 * HIV.G.DE71: Positive | Test result is positive for syphilis
 * HIV.G.DE72: Negative | Test result is negative for syphilis
 * HIV.G.DE73: Inconclusive | Test result is inconclusive
 * HIV.SRV.DE18: ANC contact date | The date and time of the client's ANC contact (in the ANC DAK this is called 'Contact date')
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: A: % of people attending HIV prevention services who tested positive for syphilis and | were treated based on national guidelines during the reporting period | B: % of people living with HIV who tested positive for syphilis and were treated based on national guidelines during the reporting period | C: % of pregnant women who tested positive for syphilis and were treated based on national guidelines during the reporting period
 * - rationale: Prompt treatment of individuals positive for syphilis is important for improving their health and reducing sexual and vertical transmission of syphilis.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records.   |  | If individual-level data are not available, the indicator can be reported using aggregate programme data.
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
