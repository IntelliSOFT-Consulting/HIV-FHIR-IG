 * Library: HIV.IND.3 Logic
 * Ref No: PRV.3
 * Short Name: PrEP coverage
 *
 * Definition: % of people prescribed PrEP among those identified as being at elevated risk for HIV acquisition
 *
 * Numerator: Number of unique individuals prescribed or dispensed any form of PrEP at least once during the reporting period. Individuals prescribed different products or regimens at different times during the reporting period should be counted only once.
 * Numerator Calculation: Count of clients with "Date medications prescribed" within reporting period AND "Medications prescribed"='PrEP for HIV prevention'
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: a) Programme/service provider level: number of individuals who received a negative HIV test during the reporting period and identified as being at elevated risk for HIV acquisition (includes people requesting/receiving any HIV prevention intervention, people from key populations, people with known risk factors or assessed as being at risk of HIV acquisition) |  | b) Population level: population-level estimate of the number of people who would benefit from PrEP, for example as derived from a PrEP need estimator tool
 * Denominator Calculation: Programme/service provider level:  | COUNT of clients with "HIV test date" within reporting period AND "HIV test result"='HIV-negative' AND "At elevated risk for HIV acquisition"=True † |  | Population level: *Estimate of the number of people who would benefit from PrEP
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other*) 
 *  • Age (15–19, 20–24, 25–49, 50+ years) 
 *  • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)** 
 *  • PrEP product and formulation (oral, long-acting device, long-acting injectable). Some people may start, continue, stop and restart, one or multiple times with different products or formulations in a given reporting period. Because of this, the percentages of recipients receiving different PrEP products may total more than 100%. 
 *  • Experience with PrEP (first time, continuing or restarting following a period of not taking PrEP) 
 *  • Provider type (key population-led or community-led organization, public sector provider, other entities such as private for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including faith-based, international, nongovernmental) 
 *  • Setting: facility-based service (including hospitals, health clinics, general practice offices, etc.) or community-based service (including drop-in centres, community service delivery points, mobile clinics or vans, outreach teams, community support groups, etc.) 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *

 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: Measures PrEP uptake among the group estimated to be vulnerable to HIV acquisition. |  | When calculated at the programme/service provider level, the denominator includes all individuals accessing the service identified as being at elevated risk for to HIV acquisition.
 * - rationale: • WHO recommends that PrEP be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of combination HIV prevention approaches. |  | • Uptake and use of PrEP reflects people's awareness and interest in lowering their risk for HIV through the use of ARVs.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records. |  | If individual-level data are not available, the indicator can be reported using aggregate programme data. Because de-duplication is not possible, individuals prescribed multiple | PrEP products or formulations at different times during the reporting period may be counted multiple times, and the number reported may be greater than the number of unique individuals receiving PrEP during the reporting period.
