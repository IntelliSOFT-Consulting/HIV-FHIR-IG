 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people starting PEP during the reporting period, excluding those whose PEP course is due to be completed after the end of the reporting period
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "Medications prescribed"='PEP for HIV prevention' AND "Date medications prescribed" within reporting period (or with expected completion date in the reporting period)
 * Denominator Exclusions:

 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other*)

 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This indicator measures the successful completion of PEP among all PEP recipients in a defined period.
 * - rationale: Individuals should be provided with adherence support to increase rates of completion of HIV PEP.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records
