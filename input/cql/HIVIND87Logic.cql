 * Short Name: HBsAg positivity, pregnant women
 *
 * Definition: Percentage of pregnant women who were tested for HBsAg and had a positive HBsAg test during the reporting period
 *
 * Numerator: Number of pregnant women who tested positive for HBsAg during the reporting period
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of "Currently pregnant" women with "HBsAg test date" on an "ANC contact date" in the reporting period AND "HBsAg test result"='HBsAg positive'
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of pregnant women tested for HBsAg during the reporting period
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of "Currently pregnant" women with "HBsAg test date" on an "ANC contact date" in the reporting period
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Age (15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–49, 50+ years) 
 *  • HIV status (HIV-positive, HIV-negative, unknown status) 
 *  • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)** 
 *  • Provider type (key population-led or community-led organization, public-sector provider, other entities such as private for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including faith-based, international, nongovernmental) 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *
 * Disaggregation Elements: Age | HIV status | Key population member type
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * ANC contact date 
 *  Currently pregnant 
 *  HBsAg test date 
 *  HBsAg test result

 * Data Concepts:
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth
 * HIV.B.DE29: Currently pregnant | Client is currently pregnant
 * HIV.B.DE50: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the client is included in
 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.B.DE55: People living in prisons and other closed settings | Client lives in a prison or another closed setting
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status
 * HIV.D.DE31: Currently pregnant | Client is currently pregnant
 * HIV.D.DE161: HBsAg test date | Date client was tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV)
 * HIV.D.DE162: HBsAg test result | Hepatitis B virus test result (HBsAg)
 * HIV.D.DE163: Positive | HBsAg test result was positive
 * HIV.D.DE164: Negative | HBsAg test result was negative
 * HIV.D.DE165: Indeterminate | HBsAg test result was indeterminate
 * HIV.E.DE85: ANC contact date | The date and time of the client's ANC contact (in the ANC DAK this is called 'Contact date')
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting
 * HIV.G.DE17: HBsAg test date | Date client was tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV)
 * HIV.G.DE18: HBsAg test result | Hepatitis B virus test result (HBsAg)
 * HIV.G.DE19: Positive | HBsAg test result was positive
 * HIV.G.DE20: Negative | HBsAg test result was negative
 * HIV.G.DE21: Indeterminate | HBsAg test result was indeterminate
 * HIV.SRV.DE7: Currently pregnant | Client is currently pregnant
 * HIV.SRV.DE18: ANC contact date | The date and time of the client's ANC contact (in the ANC DAK this is called 'Contact date')
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: A: % of people attending HIV prevention services who were tested for HBsAg and had a positive HBsAg test result during the reporting period (laboratory-based test or rapid test) | B: % of people living with HIV who were tested for HBsAg and had a positive HBsAg test result during the reporting period (laboratory-based test or rapid test) | C: % of pregnant women who were tested for HBsAg and had a positive HBsAg test result during the reporting period (laboratory-based test or rapid test)
 * - rationale: • Testing for HBV identifies HIV and HBV co-infection so that HIV treatment regimens can be adjusted to treat chronic hepatitis B infection as well. | • The HBsAg positivity rate in ANC attendees can be used to monitor the prevalence of HBV in the population and give an indication of the HBV burden.
 * - method: Patient monitoring tools (electronic or paper), for example, hepatitis and HIV testing service records, lab registers, logbooks and reporting forms at facility and community levels, EMR/electronic information systems
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
