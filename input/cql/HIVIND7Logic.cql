 * Short Name: HIV in PEP recipients
 *
 * Definition: % of PEP recipients testing HIV-positive three months after PEP was prescribed
 *
 * Numerator: Number of people testing positive for HIV three months after receiving PEP during the reporting period
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "Medications prescribed"='PEP for HIV prevention' AND "Date medications prescribed" [for PEP] within reporting period AND "HIV test date" LESS THAN 3 months after "Date medications prescribed" [for PEP] AND "HIV test result"='HIV-positive'
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people receiving PEP during the observation period. To allow for observation of a 3-month test result, the observation period must be set at least three months prior.
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "Medications prescribed"='PEP for HIV prevention' AND "Date medications prescribed" [for PEP] within reporting period
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other*) 
 *  • Age (15-19, 20-24, 25-49, 50+ years) 
 *  • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender -diverse people)2 
 *  • Exposure type (occupational, non-occupational violent, non-occupational consensual sex) 
 *  • Provider type (key population-led or community-led organization, public sector provider, other entities such as private for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including faith-based, international, nongovernmental) 
 *  • Setting: facility-based service (including hospitals, health clinics, general practice offices, etc.) or community-based service (including drop-in centres, community service delivery points, mobile clinics or vans, outreach teams, community support groups, etc.) 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age | Key population member type | HIV exposure type

 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This indicator measures HIV infection status among individuals after receiving PEP.
 * - rationale: WHO recommends all individuals potentially exposed to HIV should be encouraged to undergo HIV testing three months following the exposure.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
