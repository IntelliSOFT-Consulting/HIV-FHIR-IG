 * Short Name: Appropriate second viral load test after adherence counselling
 *
 * Definition: % of people living with HIV receiving ART with VL ≥1000 copies/mL who received a follow-up viral load test within three months
 *
 * Numerator: Number of people living with HIV on ART who received a follow-up VL test three months after a VL test result of ≥1000 copies/mL during the reporting period*
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "HIV status"='HIV-positive' AND "On ART"=True AND "Date of viral load sample collection" within reporting period AND "Viral load test result" GREATER THAN 1000 copies/mL AND follow-up "Date of viral load sample collection" LESS THAN 3 months AFTER elevated viral load result
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people living with HIV on ART with VL ≥1000 copies/mL during the reporting period
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "HIV status"='HIV-positive' AND "On ART"=True AND "Date of viral load sample collection" within reporting period AND "Viral load test result" GREATER THAN 1000 copies/mL
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other**) 
 *  • Age (0–4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–19, 20–24, 25–49, 50+ years)*** 
 *  • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)**** 
 *  • ART regimen 
 *  • Receipt of enhanced adherence counselling (yes/no/unknown) 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age | Key population member type | Current ART regimen | Enhanced adherence counselling provided

 * Data Concepts:
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth
 * HIV.A.DE18: Gender* | Gender of the client*
 * HIV.A.DE19: Female | Client identifies as female
 * HIV.A.DE20: Male | Client identifies as male
 * HIV.A.DE21: Transgender male | Client identifies as transgender male
 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category
 * HIV.B.DE50: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the client is included in
 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.B.DE55: People living in prisons and other closed settings | Client lives in a prison or another closed setting
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status
 * HIV.D.DE38: On ART | Client is currently taking ART
 * HIV.D.DE75: Current ART regimen | The current ART regimen the client is taking
 * HIV.D.DE194: Date of viral load sample collection | Date and time when the sample was collected to test the client's HIV viral load
 * HIV.D.DE387: Viral load test result | Result from the viral load test in number of copies/mL
 * HIV.D.DE496: Enhanced adherence counselling provided | Enhanced adherence counselling was provided to the client during the visit
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting
 * HIV.G.DE8: Date of viral load sample collection | Date and time when the sample was collected to test the client's HIV viral load
 * HIV.G.DE12: Viral load test result | Result from the viral load test in number of copies/mL
 * HIV.H.DE47: On ART | Client is currently taking ART 
 * HIV.SRV.DE12: Date of viral load sample collection | Date and time when the sample was collected to test the client's HIV viral load
 * HIV.SRV.DE13: Viral load test result | Result from the viral load test in number of copies/mL
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: Measures the extent to which people living with HIV with non-suppressed VL receive appropriate follow-up VL testing to check virologic suppression.
 * - rationale: • Virologic suppression is essential to the 95–95–95-related impact goals. | • This indicator complements the VL testing coverage (ART.6) and VL suppression (ART.3) indicators.
 * - method: For the numerator and denominator: HIV patient monitoring tools (for example, ART registers, EMRs, laboratory information system) |  | The recommended maximum reporting period is 12 months. Shorter reporting intervals, for example, three months, are recommended where feasible.
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
