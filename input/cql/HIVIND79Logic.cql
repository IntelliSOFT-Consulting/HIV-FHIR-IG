 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: A: % of people attending HIV prevention services who were diagnosed with the same STI | syndrome two or more times during the reporting period | B: % of people living with HIV who were diagnosed with the same STI syndrome two or more times during the reporting period
 * - rationale: Presenting with the same STI syndrome two or more times in a short period suggests that an individual was not treated appropriately, has an untreated partner or is practicing unsafe sex.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
