/**
 * Library: HIV.IND.56 Logic
 * Ref No: DSD.4
 * Short Name: Retention in DSD ART models
 *
 * Definition: % of people retained in DSD ART models during the reporting period
 *
 * Numerator: Number of people on ART known to be on treatment 12 months after enrolling in a DSD ART model* (also at 24, 36, 48, 60 months, etc. after enrolment in the model)
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "HIV status"='HIV-positive' AND "On ART"=True AND "DSD ART start date">X months before reporting period end date AND "Currently enrolled in DSD ART model"=True |  | Reported where 'X' is 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 months
 * Numerator Exclusions: Clients with an "HIV treatment outcome"='Transferred out'
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people on ART enrolled in a DSD ART model 12 months ago, excluding individuals who transferred out (also 24, 36, 48, 60 months ago, etc.)
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "HIV status"='HIV-positive' AND "On ART"=True AND "DSD ART start date">X months before reporting period end date |  | Reported where 'X' is 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 months
 * Denominator Exclusions: Clients with an "HIV treatment outcome"='Transferred out'
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other**) 
 *  • Age (0–4, 5–14, 15–24, 25+ years) 
 *  • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)*** 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age | Key population member type
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * Currently enrolled in DSD ART model 
 *  DSD ART start date 
 *  HIV status 
 *  On ART

 * Reference: Consolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV strategic information: strengthening routine data for impact. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2022
 * 
 * Data Concepts:
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth
 * HIV.A.DE18: Gender* | Gender of the client*
 * HIV.A.DE19: Female | Client identifies as female
 * HIV.A.DE20: Male | Client identifies as male
 * HIV.A.DE21: Transgender male | Client identifies as transgender male
 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category
 * HIV.B.DE50: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the client is included in
 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.B.DE55: People living in prisons and other closed settings | Client lives in a prison or another closed setting
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status
 * HIV.D.DE38: On ART | Client is currently taking ART
 * HIV.D.DE762: Currently enrolled in DSD ART model | Client currently enrolled in differentiated service delivery (DSD) ART model
 * HIV.D.DE763: DSD ART start date | Date client started on differentiated service delivery (DSD) for ART
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting
 * HIV.H.DE47: On ART | Client is currently taking ART 
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: Retention in DSD ART models among people living with HIV every 12 months after enrolment |  | This indicator is limited to facilities with electronic health information systems, as reporting would be onerous for facilities with paper-based reporting systems.
 * - rationale: As DSD ART is scaled up, it is important to monitor retention on treatment to ensure clinical outcomes at least equivalent with conventional care.
 * - method: EMR/electronic information systems |  | Measurement frequency: quarterly where feasible, maximum annually
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
