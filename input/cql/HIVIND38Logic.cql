 * Library: HIV.IND.38 Logic
 * Ref No: VER.2
 * Short Name: Early infant diagnosis (EID) coverage
 *
 * Definition: % of HIV-exposed infants who receive a virological test for HIV within two months (and 12 months) of birth
 *
 * Numerator: Number of HIV-exposed infants born during the reporting period who received a virological HIV test within two months (and 12 months) of birth
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of infants who are an "HIV-exposed infant or child" with "Infant date of birth" within the reporting period AND with "Date of viral load sample collection" LESS THAN 2 months AFTER "Infant date of birth" AND "HIV test type"='Nucleic acid test for HIV'
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Estimated number of HIV-positive women who delivered during the reporting period.   |  | Note: The denominator is a proxy measure for the number of infants born to HIV-infected women.
 * Denominator Calculation: *Estimated number of HIV-positive women who delivered during the reporting period
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Test result (HIV-positive, HIV-negative, indeterminate, other) to enable calculation of the percentage positive and the percentage with an indeterminate result among HIV-exposed infants receiving a virological test 
 *  • Age of infant (<2 months, 2-12 months) to allow the separate calculation of the proportion of exposed infants receiving virological testing within two months of birth and within 12 months of birth 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *
 * Disaggregation Elements: HIV test date (at 2 months, at 12 months) | Age of infant (<2 months, 2-12 months)
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * Date of viral load sample collection 
 *  HIV test type 
 *  HIV-exposed infant or child 
 *  Infant date of birth

 * Data Concepts:
 * HIV.B.DE81: HIV test type | Type of HIV test
 * HIV.B.DE82: Rapid diagnostic test for HIV | Antibody test for HIV performed with a rapid diagnostic
 * HIV.B.DE83: Enzyme immunoassay for HIV | Antibody test for HIV performed with an enzyme immunoassay
 * HIV.B.DE84: Nucleic acid test for HIV | Virological test, which includes testing for early infant diagnosis
 * HIV.B.DE85: Dual HIV/syphilis rapid diagnostic test | Antibody test for HIV and syphilis performed with a rapid diagnostic
 * HIV.B.DE86: HIV self-test | Antibody test for HIV performed by self-tester using a rapid diagnostic
 * HIV.B.DE110: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test
 * HIV.D.DE194: Date of viral load sample collection | Date and time when the sample was collected to test the client's HIV viral load
 * HIV.E.DE87: Infant date of birth | The infant's date of birth (DOB) if known
 * HIV.E.DE90: Age of infant | Infant age calculated using date of birth
 * HIV.E.DE112: HIV-exposed infant or child | Whether the infant or child was determined to have had HIV exposure
 * HIV.E.DE168: HIV test type | Type of HIV test
 * HIV.E.DE169: Rapid diagnostic test for HIV | Antibody test for HIV performed with a rapid diagnostic (RDT)
 * HIV.E.DE170: Enzyme immunoassay for HIV | Antibody test for HIV performed with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
 * HIV.E.DE171: Nucleic acid test for HIV | Virological test, which includes testing for early infant diagnosis
 * HIV.E.DE172: Dual HIV/syphilis rapid diagnostic test | Antibody test for HIV and syphilis performed with a rapid diagnostic
 * HIV.E.DE224: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test
 * HIV.G.DE8: Date of viral load sample collection | Date and time when the sample was collected to test the client's HIV viral load
 * HIV.SRV.DE1: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test
 * HIV.SRV.DE12: Date of viral load sample collection | Date and time when the sample was collected to test the client's HIV viral load
 * HIV.SRV.DE20: HIV-exposed infant or child | Whether the infant or child was determined to have had HIV exposure
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This indicator measures early HIV diagnosis in infants.
 * - rationale: • High coverage of early virological testing of infants helps initiate ART early in children with confirmed HIV infection and supports counselling on efforts to prevent seroconversion of those with a negative early test result. | • Current PMTCT guidelines recommend virological testing for HIV-exposed infants within two months of birth.
 * - method: For the numerator: Programme records (for example, PMTCT registers, laboratory records). |  | For the denominator: Modelling-based estimates (for example, Spectrum AIM) |  | The recommended reporting period is 12 months.
