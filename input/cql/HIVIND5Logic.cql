 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: Measure of total number of individuals receiving PEP in a defined period.
 * - rationale: PEP should be offered and initiated as early as possible for all individuals with an exposure that has the potential for HIV transmission, preferably within 72 hours.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: continuous-variable | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/cv-measure-cqfm
