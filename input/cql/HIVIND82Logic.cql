 * Short Name: HBV test coverage, pregnant women
 *
 * Definition: % of pregnant women who were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) during the reporting period (laboratory-based test or rapid test)
 *
 * Numerator: Number of pregnant women tested for HBsAg during the reporting period
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of "Currently pregnant" women with "HBsAg test date" in the reporting period
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of pregnant women attending ANC services during the reporting period
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of "Currently pregnant" women with an "ANC contact date" in reporting period
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (male, female, other*) 
 *  • Age (15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–49, 50+ years) 
 *  • HIV status (HIV-positive, HIV-negative, unknown status) 
 *  • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)** 
 *  • Provider type (key population-led or community-led organization, public-sector provider, other entities such as private for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including faith- based, international, nongovernmental) 
 *  • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 *
 * Disaggregation Elements: Age | HIV status | Key population member type
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * ANC contact date 
 *  Currently pregnant 
 *  HBsAg test date

 * 
 * Data Concepts:
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth
 * HIV.B.DE29: Currently pregnant | Client is currently pregnant
 * HIV.B.DE50: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the client is included in
 * HIV.B.DE51: Sex worker | Client is a sex worker
 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.B.DE55: People living in prisons and other closed settings | Client lives in a prison or another closed setting
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status
 * HIV.D.DE31: Currently pregnant | Client is currently pregnant
 * HIV.D.DE161: HBsAg test date | Date client was tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV)
 * HIV.E.DE85: ANC contact date | The date and time of the client's ANC contact (in the ANC DAK this is called 'Contact date')
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting
 * HIV.G.DE17: HBsAg test date | Date client was tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV)
 * HIV.SRV.DE7: Currently pregnant | Client is currently pregnant
 * HIV.SRV.DE18: ANC contact date | The date and time of the client's ANC contact (in the ANC DAK this is called 'Contact date')
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: A: % of people attending HIV prevention services who were tested for HBsAg during the | reporting period (laboratory-based test or rapid test) | B: % of people living with HIV who were tested for HBsAg during the reporting period (laboratory-based test or rapid test) | C: % of pregnant women who were tested for HBsAg during the reporting period (laboratory-based test or rapid test) | 
 * - rationale: • Measuring the HBV burden among people living with HIV and among populations at risk of HIV can help national planners determine the resources needed to address both diseases. | • Testing pregnant women for HBV in pregnancy is important for their own health, and it is also the first step in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HBV. Knowing the testing coverage contributes to quality assessment across the full scope of antenatal care services. This indicator also monitors programmatic targets used for validation in countries with a targeted HBV vaccination birth dose policy.
 * - method: Patient monitoring tools (electronic or paper), for example, hepatitis and HIV testing service records, lab registers, logbooks and reporting forms at facility and community levels, EMR/electronic information systems

 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
