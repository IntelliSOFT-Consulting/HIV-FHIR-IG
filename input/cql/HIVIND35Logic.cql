 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: Measures the incidence of serious ARV toxicities among ART patients.
 * - rationale: • As use of ARVs is scaled up, people living with HIV have the potential for prolonged exposure to ARVs and the potential to experience ARV-related toxicity. | • ARV-related toxicities are some of the most common reasons reported for ART non- adherence, treatment discontinuation or substitution of drugs and, thus, are important to monitor.
 * - method: For the numerator and denominator: HIV patient monitoring tools (ART registers, patient records/EMRs). To enable reporting codes for reasons for ART stop or switch are provided in patient monitoring tools (Web Annex H HIV patient card and Annex K ART register) |  | "Treatment-limiting" toxicity is defined as follows: A serious adverse drug reaction that results in drug discontinuation or substitution. In addition, any reaction that leads to treatment interruption or requires changing the drug or regimen because of an adverse drug reaction is also considered a serious adverse drug reaction.
