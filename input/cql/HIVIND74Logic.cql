 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: A: % of people attending HIV prevention services who tested positive for gonorrhoea | during the reporting period who were treated based on national guidelines | B: % of people living with HIV who tested positive for gonorrhoea in the reporting period who were treated based on national guidelines
 * - rationale: Prompt treatment of individuals positive for gonorrhoea is important for improving their health and reducing sexual and vertical transmission. Untreated gonorrhoea can result in pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, blindness and disseminated disease.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records.   |  | If individual-level data are not available, the indicator can be reported using aggregate programme data.
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
