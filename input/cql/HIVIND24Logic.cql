 * Short Name: HTS linkage to prevention
 *
 * Definition: Among those testing HIV-negative and identified as being at elevated risk for HIV acquisition, % of people who receive an HIV prevention intervention within defined period
 *
 * Numerator: Number of people who receive an HIV prevention intervention within a defined period after receiving a negative HIV test result
 * Numerator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "At elevated risk for HIV acquisition"=True and with "Date accessed HIV prevention intervention" within X days of "HIV test date" in the reporting period with "HIV test result"='HIV-negative' |  | where X is 7, 14, or 28 days
 * Numerator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Denominator: Number of people testing negative for HIV in the reporting period and identified as being at elevated risk for HIV acquisition (includes people requesting/receiving any HIV prevention intervention, people from key populations, people with known risk factors or those assessed as being at risk of HIV acquisition)
 * Denominator Calculation: COUNT of clients with "At elevated risk for HIV acquisition"=True AND with an "HIV test date" in the reporting period with "HIV test result"='HIV-negative'
 * Denominator Exclusions: 
 *
 * Disaggregations:
 * • Gender (female, male, other*)
 * • Age (<15, 15–19, 20–24, 25–49, 50+ years)**
 * • Key populations (men who have sex with men, people living in prisons and other closed settings, people who inject drugs, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people)***
 * • HIV prevention intervention (including PrEP, OAMT, NSP, STI services, VMMC)
 * • Provider type (key population-led or community-led organization, public sector provider, other entities such as private for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including faith-based, international, nongovernmental)
 * • Cities and other administrative regions of epidemiologic importance
 * 
 * Disaggregation Elements: Gender | Age | Key population member type | HIV prevention intervention
 *
 * Numerator and Denominator Elements:
 * At elevated risk for HIV acquisition | Date accessed HIV prevention intervention | HIV test date | HIV test result

 * HIV.B.DE52: Men who have sex with men | Client is a man who has sex with men 
 * HIV.B.DE53: Trans and gender-diverse people | Client identifies as trans and gender-diverse 
 * HIV.B.DE54: People who inject drugs | Client is a person who injects drugs

 * HIV.B.DE110: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test 
 * HIV.B.DE111: HIV test result | The result from HIV testing after applying the testing algorithm 
 * HIV.B.DE112: HIV-positive | Test result is HIV-positive 
 * HIV.B.DE113: HIV-negative | Test result is HIV-negative 
 * HIV.B.DE114: HIV-inconclusive | Test result is HIV-inconclusive 
 * HIV.B.DE225: At elevated risk for HIV acquisition | Client is at elevated risk for HIV acquisition 
 * HIV.E.DE114: Key population member type* | The type of key population that the infant's mother is included in 
 * HIV.E.DE115: Sex worker | Infant's mother is a sex worker 
 * HIV.E.DE116: People who inject drugs | Infant's mother is a person who injects drugs 
 * HIV.E.DE117: Trans and gender-diverse people | Infant's mother identifies as trans and gender-diverse 
 * HIV.E.DE118: People living in prisons and other closed setting | Infant's mother is in a prison or closed setting 
 * HIV.E.DE224: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test 
 * HIV.PRV.DE1: At elevated risk for HIV acquisition | Client is at elevated risk for HIV acquisition, defined according to country/programme context 
 * HIV.PRV.DE2: HIV prevention intervention | HIV prevention intervention that client accessed 
 * HIV.PRV.DE3: PrEP service | Client accessed PrEP services 
 * HIV.PRV.DE4: OAMT | Client accessed opioid agonist maintenance treatment (OAMT) services 
 * HIV.PRV.DE5: NSP | Client accessed needle-syringe programme (NSP) services 
 * HIV.PRV.DE6: STI services | Client accessed sexually transmitted infection (STI) services 
 * HIV.PRV.DE7: VMMC | Client accessed voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) services 
 * HIV.PRV.DE8: Other | Client accessed other HIV prevention services 
 * HIV.PRV.DE10: Date accessed HIV prevention intervention | Date the client accessed HIV prevention intervention
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: Measures the proportion of people receiving HIV prevention within set period (for example, same day, 7, 14 or 28 days) after receiving a negative HIV test result.
 * - rationale: Access to HIV prevention interventions is important to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition among individuals testing HIV-negative. Ensuring individuals at ongoing risk are successfully linked to relevant HIV prevention is an important outcome following HIV testing.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records |  | The indicator should exclude current PrEP recipients, as they are tested on a regular basis. As ongoing PrEP recipients are engaged in prevention, the number of days to intervention uptake is 0.
