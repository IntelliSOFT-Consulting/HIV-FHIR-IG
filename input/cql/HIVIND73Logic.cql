 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: A: % of people attending HIV prevention services who were tested for gonorrhoea and | had a positive test result during the reporting period | B: % of people living with HIV who were tested for gonorrhoea and had a positive test result during the reporting period
 * - rationale: • Gonorrhoea test positivity can be used to highlight areas within a country that require additional support and provide early warning of potential changes in HIV and sexually transmitted infection transmission in the general population. | • Gonorrhoea test positivity is important information for generating national, regional and global incidence and prevalence estimates for gonorrhoea. | • Data on gonorrhoea test positivity are important for understanding the challenges imposed by increasing resistance to currently recommended treatment options.
 * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records.   |  | If individual-level data are not available, the indicator can be reported using aggregate programme data.
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
