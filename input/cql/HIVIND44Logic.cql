 * Reference: Consolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV strategic information: strengthening routine data for impact. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2022
 * 
 * Data Concepts:
 * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth
 * HIV.A.DE18: Gender* | Gender of the client*
 * HIV.A.DE19: Female | Client identifies as female
 * HIV.A.DE20: Male | Client identifies as male
 * HIV.A.DE21: Transgender male | Client identifies as transgender male
 * HIV.A.DE22: Transgender female | Client identifies as transgender female
 * HIV.A.DE23: Other | Additional category
 * HIV.B.DE115: HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the national HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.
 * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive
 * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative
 * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status
 * HIV.D.DE38: On ART | Client is currently taking ART
 * HIV.D.DE954: TB preventive treatment (TPT) start date | The date on which the client began taking TPT
 * HIV.D.DE1017: Eligible for TB preventive treatment | Client is eligible for tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT)
 * HIV.D.DE1028: TPT regimen type | Type of TPT regimen the client is currently on
 * HIV.D.DE1029: 3HP | The client's current TPT regimen is 3HP
 * HIV.D.DE1030: 1HP | The client's current TPT regimen is 1HP
 * HIV.D.DE1031: 6H | The client's current TPT regimen is 6H
 * HIV.D.DE1032: Six months of levofloxacin daily | The client's current TPT regimen is six months of levofloxacin daily
 * HIV.D.DE1033: Other TB preventive treatment (TPT) regimen | The client's current TPT regimen is another regimen than those listed above
 * HIV.H.DE47: On ART | Client is currently taking ART 
 *
 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This indicator measures the extent to which people on ART initiated treatment for latent TB infection.
 * - rationale: • TB preventive treatment (TPT) is a critical component of preventing TB-related morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. | • In the wake of recent high-level global commitments and targets, this is a critical period to track the progress that countries have made in scaling up TPT coverage.
 * - method: For the numerator: Programme records (for example, ART registers) | For the denominator: Formula for determining the number of ART patients who are eligible for TPT during the reporting period | Number of people living with HIV on ART at end of last reporting period | minus | Number of notified HIV-positive TB patients in last reporting period | also minus, where possible | Number of people living with HIV who previously received TPT – actual, if available, or based on country estimate | also minus, where possible number/estimate of people living with HIV not eligible for TPT due to co-morbidities, including active hepatitis, chronic alcoholism and/or neuropathy
 * 
 * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm
